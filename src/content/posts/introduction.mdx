Hi,

we are Zita and Dan, programmers from Czechia! Welcome to our blog!

## Why are we writing this blog?

We want to share our experience with you. We want to show you how we work, what we do, and what we learn. We want to share our knowledge and help you to become a better programmer. We want to show you that programming is fun and that you can do it too!

## What can you expect from us?

We will write about our favourite technologies and about our favourite tools. We'll share with you our tips and tricks.
Our main domain is React framework, so you can expect a lot of React-related content. We will also write about other technologies, such as Node.js, TypeScript, Next, Tailwind, and many more.
Sometimes we'll browse through other technologies, such as Python, Astro, or Svelte. We'll also write about our favourite tools, such as VS Code, Git, and many more.

## Who are we?

We are a couple who's passion is programming, traveling, playing games, and doing sports.
